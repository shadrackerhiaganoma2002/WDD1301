    <h1>Welcome to Benin City</h1>
    <P> Benin City is located in close proximity to the Benin River, situated approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) to the north, whilst its eastern perimeter lies 320 kilometres (200 mi) <br> from Lagos via the arterial road network.The city's municipal boundaries
        converge with those of several prominent neighbouring towns in southern Nigeria, notably Agbor, Oghara, and Ekpoma. The city of Benin served as the paramount settlement of the Edo Kingdom of Benin, a pre-colonial polity that flourished from the
        13th to the 19th centuries. During its final centuries, <br> the kingdom maintained significant trade relations with Portugal, prior to being captured, sacked, and razed in 1897 by a British punitive expedition. This expedition resulted in the
        looting of numerous bronze sculptures from the Benin City palace, collectively referred to as the Benin Bronzes. Subsequent to their punitive victory, the British gradually colonized the area, eventually incorporating the region into Colonial
        Nigeria.
